// The State pattern enables an entity, which can change its behaviour based on its internal state, to use a set of types conforming to a common interface to represent these states. This allows behaviour related to states, and transitions between states, to be modeled in a flexible and extensible manner. The State pattern provides an effective way to implement finite state machines.
