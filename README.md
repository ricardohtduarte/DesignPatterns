# DesignPatterns

> Software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. 

This repository contains a collection of several design patterns examples using Swift. These were inspired by different articles or created by myself. Each one of these include a small definition followed by an explanation of what the main goal of the pattern is.

I used Swift Playgrounds as a mean to write and test these small code fragments (a project would be overkill :P).

These examples are divided into three categories:

- Behavioural - identify common communication patterns among objects increasing flexibility in carrying out communication
- Structural - ease the software design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities
- Creational - design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
